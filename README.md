Software Factory - The ready to use Continuous Integration platform
===================================================================

Software Factory (also called SF) is a collection of services that provides
a powerful platform to build software. It's designed to
run on an OpenStack-based cloud but it can also be used standalone
without features related to the cloud-like tests environments.
